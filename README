This is still just some web stuff that I'm playing around with. A little more
information on it - I'm trying to create a web "framework" of sorts, only I
don't want it to have a bunch of dependencies to be tied down to, nor do I want
unused packages / libraries as part of any final product made using this.

Instead I'm making a skeleton that *does* depend on configuration which can also
handle the project dependencies. 3rd party packages can be used, but I don't
believe we should assume on what packages will be needed for any given project.
As it stands, this project does contain "core" packages that are needed /used
but this is mainly just while I'm developing it. I'd like to be able to not
depend on any of these, with perhaps the exception of echo; which is what this
if mainly built up on top of.

I'll come back to this README in time.
